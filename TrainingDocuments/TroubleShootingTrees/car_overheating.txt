Overheating can cause significant damage to an engine. This troubleshooting tree is designed to help identify possible causes of overheating and guide you through a step-by-step diagnostic process.

Troubleshooting Procedure:

1. Does the overheating occur during idle or at low speeds?

YES: Go to step 2.
