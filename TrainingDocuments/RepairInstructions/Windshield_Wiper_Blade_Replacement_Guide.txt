Introduction:
Windshield wiper blades are a key safety feature that clear rain and debris from your windshield. Over time, they can become worn and require replacement. This guide provides instructions for replacing wiper blades on most vehicles.

Tools and Materials Required:

New windshield wiper blades (correct size for the vehicle)
Clean cloth or paper towel
Glass cleaner (optional)
Instructions:

Step 1: Purchase the Correct Blades

Check your vehicle’s owner’s manual for the size and type of wiper blades needed.
Purchase replacement blades from an auto parts store, making sure they match the size and attachment style of your current wipers.
Step 2: Remove Old Wiper Blades

Lift the wiper arm away from the windshield until it locks in the upright position.
Unhook the old wiper blade from the arm. This usually involves pressing a small tab or button where the blade meets the arm and sliding the blade out.
Step 3: Attach the New Wiper Blades

Align the new blade with the wiper arm and slide it into place until you hear a click, indicating it is locked in position.
Carefully lower the wiper arm with the new blade back to the windshield.
Avoid letting the wiper arm snap back against the windshield, as this could cause damage.
Step 4: Clean the Windshield

Before using the new wiper blades, it’s a good idea to clean the windshield to remove any debris or residue.
Spray the glass cleaner onto the windshield and wipe it clean with a cloth.
Step 5: Test the Wipers

Turn on the vehicle and test the wipers to ensure they are working correctly.
Watch for proper operation and listen for any unusual noises that might indicate improper installation.
Document Conclusion
Replacing wiper blades is a simple process that can greatly improve driving safety in rainy or snowy conditions. It's recommended to replace wiper blades every 6 to 12 months, depending on usage and wear.
