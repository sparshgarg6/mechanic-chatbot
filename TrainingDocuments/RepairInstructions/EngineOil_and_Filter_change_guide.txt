Introduction:
Regular oil and filter changes are vital to maintain engine health and longevity. This guide outlines the general steps involved in changing the engine oil and oil filter for most vehicles.

Tools and Materials Required:

Car owner's manual
Proper grade and amount of engine oil
New oil filter
Oil catch pan
Wrench set
Oil filter wrench
Funnel
Rags or paper towels
Gloves and safety glasses
Jack and jack stands (if necessary)
Instructions:

Step 1: Prepare for Oil Change

Make sure the engine is warm to ensure smooth oil flow but not hot to prevent burns.
Open the hood and locate the oil dipstick and filler cap.
Step 2: Drain Old Oil

Position the oil catch pan under the oil drain plug.
Use the correct-sized wrench to carefully remove the drain plug.
Allow the oil to drain completely into the pan. Be patient as this may take several minutes.
Step 3: Replace Oil Filter

Move the catch pan beneath the oil filter.
Using an oil filter wrench, twist the oil filter counterclockwise to remove it.
Before installing the new filter, apply a small amount of new oil to the rubber seal.
Install the new filter by hand, turning it clockwise until it is snug.
Step 4: Reinstall Drain Plug

After the oil has completely drained, reinstall the drain plug by hand and then tighten securely with a wrench.
Do not overtighten as this can strip the threads.
Step 5: Add New Oil

Remove the oil filler cap.
Insert a funnel into the oil filler hole.
Pour the correct amount of new oil into the engine, based on the manufacturer's recommendation.
Replace the oil filler cap.
Step 6: Check Oil Level

Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to circulate the new oil.
Turn off the engine and wait a few minutes to let the oil settle.
Remove the dipstick, wipe it clean, re-insert it, and then remove again to check the oil level.
Add more oil if the level is below the "full" mark, but do not overfill.
Step 7: Clean Up and Dispose of Oil

Use rags to clean any spilled oil around the work area.
Transfer the used oil into a sealable container.
Properly dispose of the used oil and oil filter at a recycling center or auto parts store.
Document Conclusion
Performing regular oil and filter changes is essential for the performance and longevity of your vehicle's engine. Always consult your car's owner's manual for the specific type and amount of oil, as well as the recommended oil filter. Safety and environmental considerations are paramount.
